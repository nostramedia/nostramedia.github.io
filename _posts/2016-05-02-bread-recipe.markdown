# Bumbleberry Bread

Bumbleberry bread is one of the tastiest berry breads you'll ever find. It reminds me of raisin bread
that she used to make when I was a young child.

# Ingredients

You will need:

* two cups of bumbleberries
* salt
* wheat
* sugar
* yeast


# How to make

Simply mix the dry and wet ingredients together. Add enough water and knead a little bit. Put the mixture into a baking pan
and set the oven for 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes depending on how crispy you like the bread.

# Enjoying

Dip the bread in gingersnare marmalade and enjoy with friends and family.
